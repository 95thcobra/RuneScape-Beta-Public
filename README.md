# About
This is a refactored RuneScape 2 Beta client, the revision is #186.

Based on [Leanbow's release](https://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/downloads/553361-pre-194-deob.html)

# Unrenamed
There are currently only 3 methods which haven't been named. You're welcome.

# Audio
I added a MidiPlayer class which is derived from the #414's MidiPlayer. This client supports music playing and fading, but currently does not support jingles. The Audio class uses its own thread and is a little crude at the moment. But it gets the job done.
